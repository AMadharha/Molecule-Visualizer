            Molecules are the building blocks of all matter, and the consist of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Atoms are the smallest particles that make up matter, and they are composed of subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Atoms are identified by their atomic number, which is the number of protons in their nucleus. Different atoms have different numbers of protons, which gives them unique chemical properties. For example, hydrogen atoms have one proton in their nucleus. while carbon atoms have six protons.

            When atoms combine to form molecules, they do so by sharing electrons between them. This type of bond is most commonly found in molecules made up of non-metal atoms. For example, in a molecule of water (H20), the two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom are held together by covalent bonds.

            In an ionic bond, atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions, which are charged particles. These ions then attract each other due to their opposite charges, forming a bond. Ionic bonds are most commonly found in molecules made up of metal and non-metal atoms. For example, in a molecule of sodium chloride (NaCl), the sodium ion and chloride ion are held together by an ionic bond.

            Molecules can have different shapes and sizes depending on the arrangement of atoms and bonds. The study of molecular structure is known as molecular geometry, and it plays an important role in determining the properties and behaviour of molecules.
